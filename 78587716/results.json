There is a lot here from.shopling, seating, and relaxing. From Gate B to Gate E, it is about a 14-minute walk if you crush it. When I traveled it was nighttime so a lot of shops and restaurants were already closed. This, the airport needs a but of a renovation as well. The carpets look like they are from 1980. There were not many charhers either by the seats waiting for the flights.  This airport is always packed, so if you are connecting, get ready to move to your next location as there is no tram or shuttle between gates.",
